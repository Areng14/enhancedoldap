	"Description" "Make your chamber feel more like Old Aperture by enclosing it in a giant dome. Set your chamber to be maximum size (25x25x25) then place in the bottom-center of your map. Placing toxic goo 8-12 blocks high is recommended. This item increases the compiling time drastically so you should place this item at the very end of building your chamber."
